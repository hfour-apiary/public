# H4 External API

The H4 API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts
JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response
codes, authentication, and verbs.

All endpoints are secured via:

- HTTPS transport level secuirty.
    - The fingerprint of the server-side SSL certificate is available on request to allow client
      authentication of the server.
- **A session token is required for all API calls** (see the *Authentication* section for more
  detail).

The base URL for our API-endpoints is specific to your account, but should be of the form:
`https://<unique-id>.api.hfour.com/<version>`

If we're hosting multiple H4 libraries for you:
- we will supply one URL per library
- each URL allows access to just the subset of your data that resides in that library
- the session token issued only allows read-only operations defined in this API specification

## Authentication

The H4 API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the H4 UI.

Your API keys grant access to your data, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys
in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

A typical authentication request is of the form:
```
POST /v1/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "apiKey": "8ed8224c-d13f-4098-a622-..."
}
```

...and would yield the response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "sessionToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

The session-token provided gives time-limited access to our APIs, and should be included as a `Bearer`
in the `Authorization` header for everything aside from the `/login` endpoint. E.g.:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
x 
Things to note:
- The API-key will be (one-time) retrievable and resetable from the H4 UI by your Admin users, and
have a lifespan of 30 days by default.
- The session token has a limited lifetime of 1 hour, re-authentication is required after this
period. However we'd advise securely disposing of it as soon as your interaction is done, and not
persisting it anywhere ever.

## Errors

H4 uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error
that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the
`5xx` range indicate an error with H4's servers.

## General Usage Guidelines

Our API is operationally tightly coupled to the provision of other H4 services to your account. We'd
kindly ask that you respect the following guidelines when building your integration with our API:

- **DO NOT** generate large load spikes by parallelising requests (e.g. to retrieve all pages of
  a list in parallel; to retrieve all documents and/or their content in parallel). This API is
  suitable for use in non-interactive background processing scenarios, but it is not tuned for
  web-scale loads. Please **keep API access serialised** to help us avoid large unexpected 
  spikes in load.
  - If we detect excessive load/parallel requests, we will issue HTTP `429 Too Many Requests`
    responses in the future.
- **DO NOT** persist or assume session tokens will live beyond a small window of time; make sure
  calling code handles HTTP `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` responses appropriately.
- **DO** keep track of high-watermark timestamps for polling list endpoints, to allow us to keep
  request and query load managable/incremental.

## API Versioning

All API endpoints are versioned, and require the version number to be included in the path. The
current API version is: `v1`. We will notify you of new versions and timelines for deprecation of
old versions as this happens.

## How to use this API specification

The document you're reading includes the following sections:

- `Reference` - this is where we define our available endpoints, and provide interactive elements
  to document the expected requests and responses. This includes:
  - Path for the endpoint.
  - HTTP method that shold be used (following REST conventions, e.g. GET for reads, POST for creates, PUT for updates).
  - Path parameters and/or request query parameters as necessary.
  - JSONSchema for all JSON payloads (request and respons).
  - Success response examples.
- `Dats Structures` - this is a more detailed description of the types used in the JSONSchema
  definitions.

# Group Authentication

## Login [/v1/login]

### Login and generate a session token [POST]

Prior to using any other endpoints, clients must call this endpoint to obtain a session token for use in
subsequent requests.

Two responses are possible:
- HTTP `200` status: the response should be treated as an opaque token to be used in the `Authorization`
  header of subsequent requests. The exact session token format could be changed without notice, so do
  not make any assumptions about what is returned beyond it being an opaque string.

- HTTP `403 Forbidden`: the authentication token being used is no longer valid and
  a new token should be obtained from the H4 UI. **DO NOT** attempt to carry on regardless or
  repeatedly attempt to authenticate.

# Group Library

A library is a grouping of related *records*. Each *record* is a grouped of related *documents*, typically a
`main` agreement document and zero or more `amendment` documents.

Each *document* may have associated *metadata*. The *record* also has a consolidated *metadata* data-structure
which contains the aggregate of all child *document*'s *metadata*.

## Records [/v1/library/records]

Records and information about their contained documents can be retrieved via this endpoint and it's children.

### List all records [GET /v1/library/records{?since,page}]

Retrieval all library records that have been created or updated since a given timestamp.

Things to note:
- The response is paged; total results, current page and page size are available via response headers
  `X-Total`, `X-Page` and `X-PageSize` respectively.
- `since` should be tracked by the client, so that subsequent calls are restricted to a sane time window,
  as described in the *General Usage Guidelines* section.
  - as a compromise, it might be acceptable for a daily job quering this endpoint to request the
    last N days of updates, providing it can deduplicate updates already seen.
- the full *record* state is returned for all *records* found to match the time-range specified.

    + Attributes (LibraryRecord)

### Retrieve document content [GET /v1/library/records/{recordId}/{documentId}{?format}]

Retrieve the human-readable content for a specific *record* and it's child *document*.

Things to note:
- Depending on the status of the `document`, this endpoint will either directly serve
  the content, or issue a HTTP `302` redirect to a secure URL where the content can be
  retrieved. Clients should be aware of this scenario and behave accordingly.
  - Be aware that the returned URL is only accessible for a short time period, typically
    < 5 minutes. Clients should follow the redirect immediately to retrieve content
    in this scenario.
  - For mocking purposes, the examples return a `github.com` URL; the real API response
    for the `302` case is likely to be a signed URL from a Cloud service provider, e.g:
    ```
